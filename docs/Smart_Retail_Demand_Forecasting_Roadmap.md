# Smart Retail Demand Forecasting — Academic Project Roadmap

### Refined Proposal + Functional Requirements + Execution Workflow

**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** March 2026 | **Project Type:** Data Science Semester Project

---

## SECTION 1 — Refined Project Definition

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Retail chains managing thousands of SKUs face dual failure mode: overstocking generates capital inefficiency and spoilage risk (perishable categories), understocking causes revenue leakage and customer churn. Existing demand planning tools apply univariate time-series models per SKU, ignore three critical dynamics:

1. **Promotional lift** — transient demand spikes from discounts, bundles, end-cap placements.
2. **Cannibalization** — one product's promotion suppresses adjacent SKU demand within same category.
3. **Cross-SKU interaction** — correlated demand patterns across product lines driven by seasonality, consumer habits, complementarity.

Project builds **multi-family retail demand forecasting system** using Corporación Favorita data (Ecuador's largest grocery chain). Produces accurate daily sales predictions, quantifies promotional impact, identifies cannibalization pairs across 33 product families, 54 stores.

---

### 1.2 ML Problem Type

| Dimension | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Primary task** | Supervised regression (continuous sales volume prediction) |
| **Secondary task** | Unsupervised clustering (cannibalization group detection) |
| **Problem subtype** | Multi-step time-series forecasting (16-day-ahead horizon, per competition spec) |
| **Scope** | Multi-family, multi-store panel regression (54 stores × 33 product families) |

---

### 1.3 Target Variable

- **`sales`** — total unit sales for product family at specific store on given date. Fractional values valid (e.g., 1.5 kg cheese).
- One row = one `(store_nbr, family, date)` triple.
- Prediction horizon: **16 days ahead** (Aug 16–31, 2017), matching competition test window. Academic hold-out evaluation period.

---

### 1.4 Input Features (Expected)

| Feature Category | Specific Features (Favorita columns) |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Temporal** | `day_of_week`, `day_of_month`, `week_of_year`, `month`, `quarter`, `year`, `is_weekend` |
| **Holiday features** (`holidays_events.csv`) | `is_national_holiday`, `is_regional_holiday`, `is_local_holiday`, `holiday_type`, `days_to_holiday`, `is_transferred` |
| **Lag features** | `sales_lag_1d`, `sales_lag_7d`, `sales_lag_14d`, `sales_lag_365d` |
| **Rolling statistics** | `rolling_mean_7d`, `rolling_mean_14d`, `rolling_mean_28d`, `rolling_std_7d` |
| **Promotional** | `onpromotion` (count of items on promotion per family/store/day) |
| **Store metadata** (`stores.csv`) | `store_type` (A–E), `store_cluster` (1–17), `city`, `state` |
| **Macroeconomic** (`oil.csv`) | `dcoilwtico` (daily WTI crude oil price — direct economic driver for Ecuador) |
| **Transaction volume** (`transactions.csv`) | `transactions` (daily store-level foot traffic — leading indicator of sales) |
| **Cross-family (cannibalization)** | `family_avg_onpromotion`, `competitor_family_sales_lag_1d` (top-3 correlated families per store) |

---

### 1.5 Assumptions

1. **Dataset**: Corporación Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting dataset (Kaggle: `store-sales-time-series-forecasting`). Contains 54 stores, 33 product families, daily sales **January 1, 2013 to August 31, 2017** (~3 million rows). Six CSV files: `train.csv`, `test.csv`, `stores.csv`, `oil.csv`, `holidays_events.csv`, `transactions.csv`.
2. **Granularity**: Forecasting at `(store_nbr, family, date)` level (daily). "SKU" referenced = `(store, product_family)` pair.
3. **Cannibalization proxy**: True basket-level cannibalization unavailable from dataset. Cross-elasticity between product families estimated using lagged residual sales of correlated families during `onpromotion > 0` periods.
4. **Oil price imputation**: `dcoilwtico` has ~44 missing values (weekends/holidays). Strategy: forward-fill, then backward-fill. Oil price documented economic driver for Ecuador, must be included.
5. **Evaluation period**: Official competition test period Aug 16–31, 2017 (16 days). Academic grading uses same window as hold-out test set. Training uses all data before Aug 16, 2017.
6. **From-scratch gradient descent**: Linear Regression with Gradient Descent (GD) implemented manually (NumPy only) as baseline interpretability model, satisfies proposal deliverable requirement.

---

### 1.6 Success Metrics

| Metric | Primary Use | Target Threshold |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **RMSLE** (Root Mean Squared Log Error) | **Official competition metric** — primary | < 0.45 |
| **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error) | Raw-scale interpretability | Minimize |
| **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) | Scale-invariant comparison across families | < 15% |
| **R²** | Variance explained | > 0.80 |

> **Why RMSLE?** Target `sales` right-skewed, includes zero values. RMSLE penalizes under-prediction more than over-prediction, appropriate for retail (stockout cost > overstock cost). Compute: `RMSLE = sqrt(mean((log1p(y_pred) - log1p(y_true))^2))`.

> **Cannibalization sub-metric**: Pearson cross-correlation coefficient between `onpromotion`-activated family residual sales and adjacent family residual sales. Negative correlation (< −0.3) during promotion windows = cannibalization evidence.

## SECTION 2 — Functional Requirements (8 Requirements)

---

### FR-01: Data Ingestion and Validation Module

**Description:**
System loads all six Favorita CSV files (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, `stores.csv`, `oil.csv`, `holidays_events.csv`, `transactions.csv`), merges on keys (`store_nbr` + `date`), performs automated schema validation: column existence checks, data type verification, range checks (e.g., `sales` ≥ 0), null-count reporting per column.

**Why necessary:**
Without validated, merged base dataset no downstream processing possible. Favorita dataset requires multi-table joins across 6 files with different key structures — join error silently corrupts features like `dcoilwtico` or `transactions` for entire stores.

**Measurable Acceptance Criteria:**

- All six source files merged into single panel DataFrame; merge diagnostics (left-join null counts) printed.
- Validation report auto-generated listing: shape, dtypes, null counts per column, `sales < 0` violations.
- Merged DataFrame contains exactly `54 stores × 33 families × training_days` rows (minus missing combinations); discrepancy flagged.
- Execution time ≤ 60 seconds on standard laptop (dataset ~3M rows).

---

### FR-02: Data Preprocessing Pipeline

**Description:**
Pipeline handles: (a) forward-fill imputation of missing `dcoilwtico` values (weekends/public holidays no oil price recorded), (b) classification of holidays in `holidays_events.csv` — distinguish `transferred=True` holidays (treat as workday) from active holidays, (c) outlier detection using IQR per `(store_nbr, family)` group, (d) temporal ordering of all records by `(store_nbr, family, date)`.

**Why necessary:**
Favorita `oil.csv` has ~44 missing rows (no trading weekends). `holidays_events.csv` contains `transferred=True` rows marking days officially designated holidays but observed different date — treating these as holidays introduces incorrect feature values. Unhandled missing oil prices propagate NaN through downstream features.

**Measurable Acceptance Criteria:**

- After preprocessing, `dcoilwtico` has 0% null values; imputation method documented.
- Transferred holidays correctly excluded from `is_holiday` flag (Boolean logic verified on ≥ 2 known transfer dates).
- All records sorted chronologically within each `(store_nbr, family)` group.
- Final preprocessed DataFrame has reproducible row count logged to file.

---

### FR-03: Feature Engineering Module

**Description:**
Construct following feature groups programmatically:

1. **Temporal features**: `day_of_week`, `day_of_month`, `week_of_year`, `month`, `quarter`, `year`, `is_weekend`.
2. **Holiday features**: `is_national_holiday`, `is_regional_holiday`, `is_local_holiday`, `holiday_type` (encoded), `days_to_nearest_holiday`, `is_transferred` (binary).
3. **Lag features**: Sales lag at 1, 7, 14, and 365 days per `(store_nbr, family)` group.
4. **Rolling statistics**: 7-day, 14-day, and 28-day rolling mean and standard deviation per `(store_nbr, family)` group.
5. **Promotional feature**: `onpromotion` (raw count from `train.csv`), `onpromotion_lag_1d`, `onpromotion_rolling_7d`.
6. **Macroeconomic**: `dcoilwtico` (oil price), `dcoilwtico_lag_7d`, `dcoilwtico_rolling_28d`.
7. **Transaction volume**: `transactions` (from `transactions.csv`), `transactions_lag_7d`.
8. **Store metadata**: `store_type` (label-encoded A–E), `store_cluster` (1–17), `city`, `state` (target-encoded by mean sales).
9. **Cannibalization proxy features**: For each `(store, family, date)`, add lagged mean sales of top-3 most correlated other families in same store.

**Why necessary:**
Raw temporal data provides no signal to tree-based models (cannot extrapolate). Lag and rolling features encode autoregressive dynamics essential for time-series forecasting. Without these, models degrade to simple cross-sectional regressors.

**Measurable Acceptance Criteria:**

- All 9 feature groups present in final feature matrix.
- Lag features contain NaN only for first `k` rows per group (where `k` = lag period); these rows dropped before model training.
- Feature engineering implemented as reusable Python class/function accepting DataFrame, returning augmented DataFrame.
- Unit test: confirm `sales_lag_7d` of constructed test series equals known ground truth.

---

### FR-04: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Module

**Description:**
EDA module produces following documented outputs: (a) time-series decomposition plots (trend, seasonality, residual) for ≥ 3 `(store_nbr, family)` combinations using `statsmodels.seasonal_decompose`, (b) correlation heatmap of numerical features, (c) distribution plots for `sales` and `onpromotion`, (d) holiday lift analysis — bar chart comparing mean sales across national, regional, local, and non-holiday days, (e) oil price vs. aggregate sales scatter plot over time, (f) cross-family correlation matrix to identify cannibalization candidate pairs.

**Why necessary:**
EDA primary mechanism for validating assumptions about data. Without it, feature engineering decisions (e.g., lag window size, seasonal period) arbitrary, undefended in academic evaluation.

**Measurable Acceptance Criteria:**

- Minimum 10 publication-quality figures saved to `/outputs/eda/` directory.
- Each figure has titles, axis labels, source annotations.
- EDA notebook/script outputs ≥ 3 documented insights (written as markdown cells) directly informing feature engineering or modeling decisions.
- Time-series decomposition uses `period=365` (daily data, annual seasonality), explicitly documented.

---

### FR-05: Model Training Pipeline (Baseline + Advanced)

**Description:**
Implement and train following models in sequence:

1. **Baseline 1**: Seasonal Naive (persistence model — predict last year's same-week value).
2. **Baseline 2**: Linear Regression with Gradient Descent (implemented from scratch using NumPy; no `sklearn.LinearRegression`).
3. **Advanced 1**: XGBoost Regressor.
4. **Advanced 2**: LightGBM Regressor.
5. _(Optional)_ **Advanced 3**: Prophet (Facebook), if time permits.

All models use **temporal train/test split**: training on data Jan 1, 2013 to Aug 15, 2017; test set Aug 16–31, 2017 (official 16-day competition window). No random shuffling of time-series data.

**Why necessary:**
Baseline model required to establish performance floor. Without it, advanced model improvements cannot be quantified or defended. From-scratch GD implementation satisfies stated project deliverable requirement.

**Measurable Acceptance Criteria:**

- All models produce predictions on held-out 16-day test set.
- Training and inference times logged per model.
- From-scratch GD implementation converges (loss decreases monotonically or plateaus) within 1000 iterations; convergence curve plotted.
- Zero data leakage: documented check confirming no test-set dates (Aug 16–31, 2017) appear in any training feature window.

---

### FR-06: Hyperparameter Tuning Module

**Description:**
Tune XGBoost and LightGBM using one of: (a) `GridSearchCV` with `TimeSeriesSplit` (5 folds), or (b) Bayesian optimization using `Optuna`. Following hyperparameters must be included in search space:

- XGBoost: `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `learning_rate`, `subsample`, `colsample_bytree`.
- LightGBM: `num_leaves`, `max_depth`, `learning_rate`, `min_child_samples`, `feature_fraction`.

**Why necessary:**
Default hyperparameters result in suboptimal models. More critically, standard `KFold` cross-validation on time-series data causes data leakage (future data used to predict past). `TimeSeriesSplit` enforces temporal ordering.

**Measurable Acceptance Criteria:**

- Tuning uses `TimeSeriesSplit` with `n_splits ≥ 3`; explicitly configured and logged.
- Best hyperparameters saved to JSON file (e.g., `best_params_xgb.json`).
- Post-tuning RMSE improves by ≥ 3% relative to pre-tuning RMSE on validation fold (or result and explanation explicitly documented if improvement marginal).
- Total tuning wall-clock time logged.

---

### FR-07: Model Evaluation Framework

**Description:**
Centralized evaluation module computes following for every trained model: RMSE, MAPE, R², and MAE on held-out test set. Additionally: (a) plot actual vs. predicted sales for top-5 store-department combinations by sales volume, (b) compute residual plots and check for systematic bias (mean residual significantly ≠ 0 indicates model misspecification), (c) perform SHAP value analysis on best-performing tree model to identify top-10 most important features.

**Why necessary:**
Single metric insufficient for model assessment. Residual analysis detects heteroscedasticity and structural bias. SHAP analysis provides feature importances consistent (unlike built-in tree importance), required for cannibalization and promotion-effect interpretation deliverables.

**Measurable Acceptance Criteria:**

- All 4 metrics reported in comparative table (model vs. metric).
- Actual vs. predicted plots generated for ≥ 5 store-dept series.
- SHAP summary plot identifies ≥ 1 promotional feature and 1 temporal feature in top-5.
- Residual mean reported per model; if `|mean residual| > 5%` of mean actual sales, bias explanation documented.

---

### FR-08: Cannibalization & Promotional Impact Analysis Module

**Description:**
This module must:

1. Compute **cross-department correlation matrix** on residual sales (sales net of trend and seasonality), targeting periods with active markdowns.
2. Identify **cannibalization candidate pairs** using threshold of Pearson r < −0.35 during promotional periods.
3. Quantify **promotional lift** for each markdown event: `lift = (actual_sales - counterfactual_baseline) / counterfactual_baseline`, where counterfactual baseline = rolling 4-week pre-promo average.
4. Produce scatter plot of markdown amount vs. promotional lift per department.

**Why necessary:**
Highest-differentiation deliverable in proposal. Elevates project from standard regression exercise to business-insight-generating analysis. Without it, project fails own stated objective of "quantifying cannibalization."

**Measurable Acceptance Criteria:**

- ≥ 3 statistically significant cannibalization pairs identified and documented (Pearson r and p-value reported).
- Promotional lift computed for ≥ 10 distinct markdown events.
- Final cannibalization report (3–5 pages) saved as PDF or markdown document with visual evidence.
- All findings reproducible by re-running module script with same random seed.

---

### FR-09: Model Persistence and Reporting Module

**Description:**
(a) Best-performing model saved using `joblib` (or `pickle` for GD model) to `/models/` directory with filename convention: `model_name_YYYYMMDD_vX.pkl`. (b) Final project report template (Jupyter Notebook + exported HTML/PDF) structured with: executive summary, methodology, results table, EDA highlights, model comparison, cannibalization findings, limitations, and future work sections.

**Why necessary:**
Model persistence mandatory for reproducibility — core academic requirement. Without structured report, findings exist only in scattered notebook cells, insufficient for academic submission.

**Measurable Acceptance Criteria:**

- Saved model reloads, produces identical predictions (bit-for-bit) on test set without retraining.
- Final report template has all 8 required sections defined.
- Report notebook executes end-to-end (Kernel → Restart & Run All) without errors.
- Exported HTML/PDF report file size ≤ 20MB.

## SECTION 3 — Complete Data Science Workflow (Step-by-Step)

---

### PHASE 1 — Problem Framing

**Inputs:** Project proposal PDF, domain knowledge, dataset documentation.  
**Outputs:** Signed-off problem statement, metric definitions, feasibility assessment.

**Steps:**

1. Formalize forecasting objective: _"Minimize RMSLE on daily sales prediction for held-out Aug 16–31, 2017 test period across all (store_nbr, family) pairs."_
2. Confirm prediction horizon: **16 days ahead** (fixed by competition). Academic purposes: also report RMSE and MAPE.
3. Define success thresholds: RMSLE < 0.45; MAPE < 15%; R² > 0.80.
4. Define constraints:
   - No data beyond Favorita competition dataset used unless explicitly noted.
   - Temporal integrity must be preserved: no shuffling of time-series.
   - From-scratch gradient descent implementation mandatory (per deliverables).
5. Document all assumptions (see Section 1.5).
6. Confirm dataset availability: download Favorita dataset from Kaggle, verify file hashes.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

- Treating this as classification problem (sales continuous — use regression metrics).
- Defining MAPE as only metric (MAPE undefined when actual = 0; use RMSLE as primary — `log1p` handles zeros).
- Failing to account for temporal nature — this is NOT standard i.i.d. regression problem.

---

### PHASE 2 — Data Acquisition

**Inputs:** Kaggle API key or manual download.  
**Outputs:** Raw data files stored in `/data/raw/`, integrity-verified.

**Steps:**

1. Register for Kaggle API, download dataset:
   ```bash
   kaggle competitions download -c store-sales-time-series-forecasting
   unzip store-sales-time-series-forecasting.zip -d data/raw/
   ```
   Files: `train.csv` (~3M rows), `test.csv` (28,512 rows), `stores.csv`, `oil.csv`, `holidays_events.csv`, `transactions.csv`, `sample_submission.csv`.
2. Verify file sizes match expected (e.g., `train.csv` ≈ 112MB uncompressed, 54 stores × 33 families).
3. Document dataset provenance:
   - Source: Kaggle — Store Sales Time Series Forecasting Competition (2021)
   - Data origin: Corporación Favorita, Ecuador
   - License: Kaggle competition rules (academic/educational use)
   - Citation: _Corporación Favorita. (2021). Store Sales — Time Series Forecasting. Kaggle. https://kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting_
4. Load all files into Pandas DataFrames, print `.info()` and `.describe()` for each.
5. Record: row counts per file, column types, memory usage, date range (`2013-01-01` to `2017-08-31`), store count (54), family count (33).

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

- Using Kaggle test set (`test.csv`) for model evaluation — no ground truth `sales` labels. Create own hold-out split from `train.csv` using final 16 days.
- Not logging which dataset version used. Store download timestamp, save SHA-256 hashes of all input files to `data/checksums.txt`.

---

### PHASE 3 — Data Preprocessing

**Inputs:** Raw merged DataFrame.  
**Outputs:** Cleaned DataFrame saved to `/data/processed/cleaned_data.parquet`.

**Steps:**

**3.1 — Merge all source tables:**

```python
train = pd.read_csv('data/raw/train.csv', parse_dates=['date'])
stores = pd.read_csv('data/raw/stores.csv')
oil    = pd.read_csv('data/raw/oil.csv', parse_dates=['date'])
holidays = pd.read_csv('data/raw/holidays_events.csv', parse_dates=['date'])
txns   = pd.read_csv('data/raw/transactions.csv', parse_dates=['date'])

df = train.merge(stores, on='store_nbr', how='left')
df = df.merge(oil, on='date', how='left')
df = df.merge(txns, on=['store_nbr', 'date'], how='left')
# Holidays processed separately, joined as feature flags (see 3.2)
```

**3.2 — Handle missing oil prices and engineer holiday flags:**

- `dcoilwtico`: ~44 missing values. Strategy: **forward-fill, then backward-fill** within date-sorted series. Document count of filled rows.
- `holidays_events.csv` processing:
  ```python
  # Keep only non-transferred holidays as actual holidays
  active_holidays = holidays[holidays['transferred'] == False].copy()
  # Create separate flags per locale
  national = active_holidays[active_holidays['locale'] == 'National'][['date','type']]
  df['is_national_holiday'] = df['date'].isin(national['date']).astype(int)
  # Repeat for Regional (match locale_name to state) and Local (match to city)
  ```
- `transactions`: ~2% missing (some store-days no records). Forward-fill within `store_nbr` group.

**3.3 — Handle zero `sales`:**

- Zero sales **valid** in Favorita dataset (store may genuinely sell zero units of product family on given day). Do NOT impute or remove zeros.
- Log count and percentage of zero-sale rows per family as data quality note.

**3.4 — Outlier handling:**

- Compute IQR per `(store_nbr, family)` group.
- Flag rows with `sales > Q3 + 3*IQR` as outliers (extreme spike days, e.g., during earthquake 2016). Do NOT remove; add `is_outlier` binary flag for model awareness.
- Note: April 2016 Ecuador earthquake caused documented sales anomalies — flag this date range (`2016-04-16` to `2016-05-15`) explicitly.

**3.5 — Data type enforcement:**

- Convert `date` to `datetime64`.
- Label-encode `type` (store type: A–E → 0–4) and `cluster` (already integer).
- Target-encode `city` and `state` using leave-one-out mean encoding on training data only.
- Encode `family` (33 categories) using label encoding or target encoding.

**3.6 — Sort and index:**

```python
df = df.sort_values(['store_nbr', 'family', 'date']).reset_index(drop=True)
```

**3.7 — Save cleaned data:**

```python
df.to_parquet('data/processed/cleaned_data.parquet', index=False)
```

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

- Global forward-fill for oil prices across all rows without sorting by date first — corrupts temporal order.
- Including transferred holidays as active holidays — use `holidays[holidays['transferred'] == False]`.
- Not sorting by `(store_nbr, family, date)` before computing lag features (lags mismatched across groups).

---

### PHASE 4 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Inputs:** Cleaned DataFrame.  
**Outputs:** Minimum 10 saved figures in `/outputs/eda/`, EDA insights documented.

**Steps:**

**4.1 — Statistical summaries:**

- `.describe()` for all numerical columns.
- Per-store and per-family mean/median daily sales.
- Holiday vs. non-holiday mean sales comparison (ANOVA across national/regional/local/none; report F-statistic and p-values).
- Oil price trend over training period (2013–2017); annotate 2015–2016 oil price crash and correlation with aggregate sales.

**4.2 — Time-series decomposition:**

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
# Use daily data: aggregate one (store, family) series first
series = df[(df['store_nbr']==1) & (df['family']=='GROCERY I')].set_index('date')['sales']
result = seasonal_decompose(series, model='additive', period=365)
```

- Perform for 3 representative `(store_nbr, family)` pairs (high volume: GROCERY I; promotional: BEVERAGES; volatile: PRODUCE).
- Inspect: trend direction (growth/decline 2013–2017), seasonal amplitude, residual spikes around holidays.

**4.3 — Distribution analysis:**

- Histogram + KDE of `sales` — confirm right-skew and zero-inflation (log1p-transform recommended).
- Box plots of `sales` by `store_type` (A–E) and by `is_national_holiday`.
- Distribution of `onpromotion` values (note zero-inflation; most family-store-days have 0 items on promotion).

**4.4 — Correlation analysis:**

- Pearson correlation heatmap: `sales` vs. all numerical features (`onpromotion`, `dcoilwtico`, `transactions`, lag features).
- Cross-family correlation matrix (pivot to wide format, one column per family, correlate residual sales during `onpromotion > 0` periods).
- Highlight pairs with |r| > 0.6 (cannibalization candidates, e.g., BEVERAGES vs. LIQUOR/WINE/BEER).

**4.5 — Key visualizations to produce:**
| # | Plot | Purpose |
|---|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Daily aggregate sales time-series (2013–2017) | Global trend detection + holiday spikes |
| 2 | Seasonal decomposition (3 store-family series) | Validate `period=365`, confirm annual pattern |
| 3 | Correlation heatmap (numerical features) | Feature selection signal |
| 4 | Holiday lift bar chart (national/regional/local) | Quantify multi-level holiday effect |
| 5 | Sales by store type (A–E) box plot | Stratification signal |
| 6 | Oil price vs. aggregate sales (dual-axis) | Macroeconomic effect visualization |
| 7 | Cross-family correlation matrix | Cannibalization candidate identification |
| 8 | ACF/PACF plots (3 representative series) | Guide lag feature window selection |
| 9 | `onpromotion` count vs. sales scatter | Promotion-sales relationship |
| 10 | Transactions vs. sales scatter (daily) | Foot traffic as leading sales indicator |

**4.6 — Insights to document (minimum 3):**

- Example: _"BEVERAGES and LIQUOR/WINE/BEER exhibit negative correlation r = −0.48 during `onpromotion > 0` weeks in Store 1, suggesting cannibalization."_
- Example: _"ACF plot for GROCERY I shows significant autocorrelation at lags 7, 14, and 365, confirming weekly and annual seasonality."_
- Example: _"National holidays show 31% mean sales lift; regional holidays show only 9% — indicating holiday effect locale-specific, must be encoded with granularity."_
- Example: _"Oil price dropped 60% between mid-2014 and early-2016; aggregate store sales declined ~8% over same window, suggesting macroeconomic sensitivity."_

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

- Computing correlations on unsorted data without time-alignment.
- Using `period=52` for daily data — correct period is **365** (or 7 for weekly seasonality; test both).
- Conflating Pearson correlation with causation in cannibalization analysis.

---

### PHASE 5 — Feature Engineering

**Inputs:** Cleaned DataFrame.  
**Outputs:** Feature matrix saved to `/data/processed/features.parquet`.

**Steps:**

**5.1 — Temporal features:**

```python
df['day_of_week']  = df['date'].dt.dayofweek
df['day_of_month'] = df['date'].dt.day
df['week_of_year'] = df['date'].dt.isocalendar().week.astype(int)
df['month']    = df['date'].dt.month
df['quarter']  = df['date'].dt.quarter
df['year']     = df['date'].dt.year
df['is_weekend'] = (df['day_of_week'] >= 5).astype(int)
```

**5.2 — Holiday proximity:**

```python
# Pre-process holidays_events.csv (already done in Phase 3)
# Add days_to_nearest_holiday
holiday_dates = active_holidays['date'].unique()
df['days_to_nearest_holiday'] = df['date'].apply(
    lambda d: min(abs((d - h).days) for h in holiday_dates)
)
```

**5.3 — Lag features (within `(Store, Dept)` group):**

```python
# Daily lags within (store_nbr, family) group
for lag in [1, 7, 14, 365]:
    df[f'sales_lag_{lag}d'] = df.groupby(['store_nbr', 'family'])['sales'].shift(lag)
```

**5.4 — Rolling statistics:**

```python
for window in [7, 14, 28]:
    df[f'rolling_mean_{window}d'] = df.groupby(['store_nbr', 'family'])['sales'].transform(
        lambda x: x.shift(1).rolling(window).mean()
    )
    df[f'rolling_std_{window}d'] = df.groupby(['store_nbr', 'family'])['sales'].transform(
        lambda x: x.shift(1).rolling(window).std()
    )
```

> **Critical**: Always shift by 1 before rolling to avoid target leakage.

**5.5 — Promotional features:**

```python
# onpromotion already in train.csv per (store_nbr, family, date)
df['onpromotion_lag_1d']   = df.groupby(['store_nbr', 'family'])['onpromotion'].shift(1)
df['onpromotion_rolling7d'] = df.groupby(['store_nbr', 'family'])['onpromotion'].transform(
    lambda x: x.shift(1).rolling(7).mean()
)
# Oil price lags
df['oil_lag_7d']       = df['dcoilwtico'].shift(7)  # global; no groupby needed
df['oil_rolling_28d']  = df['dcoilwtico'].shift(1).rolling(28).mean()
```

**5.6 — Cannibalization proxy features:**

- Identify top-3 correlated product families per store (from EDA cross-family correlation matrix during `onpromotion > 0` periods).
- For each `(store_nbr, family, date)`, add 7-day lagged mean sales of those correlated families.

**5.7 — Feature selection:**

- Remove features with > 90% zero values.
- Apply Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to detect multicollinearity among numerical features.
- Drop features with VIF > 10 if using linear models.
- For tree models, collinearity acceptable — feature selection based on SHAP importance post-training.

**5.8 — Drop NaN rows created by lags:**

```python
df.dropna(subset=['sales_lag_365d'], inplace=True)  # Most restrictive lag
```

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

- Computing rolling mean without `.shift(1)` — leaks current day's sales into itself.
- Computing lags globally without `groupby` — lags cross `(store_nbr, family)` boundaries.
- Not dropping NaN rows from 365-day lag (removes first year of data per series — expected and correct, leaving 4+ years for training).

---

### PHASE 6 — Model Development

**Inputs:** Feature matrix, train/test temporal split.  
**Outputs:** Trained model objects saved to `/models/`.

**Temporal Split (non-negotiable):**

```python
cutoff_date = pd.Timestamp('2017-08-16')  # Official competition test start
X_train = df[df['date'] < cutoff_date].drop(columns=['sales', 'date'])
y_train = df[df['date'] < cutoff_date]['sales']
X_test  = df[df['date'] >= cutoff_date].drop(columns=['sales', 'date'])
y_test  = df[df['date'] >= cutoff_date]['sales']
```

**Step 6.1 — Baseline 1: Seasonal Naive**

```python
# Prediction = same day's sales from 365 days ago (within each store-family group)
y_pred_naive = df.groupby(['store_nbr','family'])['sales'].shift(365)
```

**Step 6.2 — Baseline 2: Linear Regression with Gradient Descent (from scratch)**

```python
# Pure NumPy implementation
def gradient_descent(X, y, lr=0.001, iterations=1000):
    m, n = X.shape
    theta = np.zeros(n)
    loss_history = []
    for i in range(iterations):
        predictions = X @ theta
        errors = predictions - y
        gradient = (2/m) * (X.T @ errors)
        theta -= lr * gradient
        loss_history.append(np.mean(errors**2))
    return theta, loss_history
```

- Normalize features with `StandardScaler` before feeding to GD.
- Plot loss curve to confirm convergence.

**Step 6.3 — Advanced Model 1: XGBoost**

```python
import xgboost as xgb
model_xgb = xgb.XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=500, max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.05,
    subsample=0.8, colsample_bytree=0.8,
    early_stopping_rounds=50, random_state=42
)
model_xgb.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_set=[(X_test, y_test)], verbose=100)
```

**Step 6.4 — Advanced Model 2: LightGBM**

```python
import lightgbm as lgb
model_lgb = lgb.LGBMRegressor(
    num_leaves=63, max_depth=7, learning_rate=0.05,
    n_estimators=500, min_child_samples=20,
    feature_fraction=0.8, random_state=42
)
model_lgb.fit(X_train, y_train,
              eval_set=[(X_test, y_test)],
              callbacks=[lgb.early_stopping(50)])
```

**Step 6.5 — Cross-Validation (TimeSeriesSplit):**

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit, cross_val_score
tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)
cv_scores = cross_val_score(model_xgb, X_train, y_train, cv=tscv, scoring='neg_root_mean_squared_error')
```

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

- Using `train_test_split(shuffle=True)` on time-series — future data leaks into training.
- Using `KFold` instead of `TimeSeriesSplit` for cross-validation.
- Not setting `random_state=42` consistently — results not reproducible.
- Fitting `StandardScaler` on entire dataset before splitting (scaler must be fit on training data only).

---

### PHASE 7 — Model Evaluation

**Inputs:** Trained models, test set predictions.  
**Outputs:** Metrics table, residual plots, SHAP analysis.

**Steps:**

**7.1 — Compute metrics for each model:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_percentage_error, r2_score
import numpy as np

def evaluate_model(y_true, y_pred, model_name):
    rmsle = np.sqrt(np.mean((np.log1p(y_pred.clip(0)) - np.log1p(y_true)) ** 2))
    rmse  = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred))
    # MAPE: exclude zero actuals to avoid division by zero
    mask  = y_true > 0
    mape  = mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_true[mask], y_pred[mask]) * 100
    r2    = r2_score(y_true, y_pred)
    print(f"{model_name}: RMSLE={rmsle:.4f}, RMSE={rmse:.2f}, MAPE={mape:.2f}%, R²={r2:.4f}")
    return {'model': model_name, 'RMSLE': rmsle, 'RMSE': rmse, 'MAPE': mape, 'R2': r2}
```

**7.2 — Produce comparison table:**

| Model | RMSLE | RMSE | MAPE (%) | R² |
|-------|-------|------|----------|----|
| Seasonal Naive | — | — | — | — |
| GD Linear Regression | — | — | — | — |
| XGBoost (tuned) | — | — | — | — |
| LightGBM (tuned) | — | — | — | — |

_(Fill with actual experimental results)_

**7.3 — Residual analysis:**

```python
residuals = y_test - y_pred
plt.scatter(y_pred, residuals, alpha=0.3)
plt.axhline(0, color='red')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Sales'); plt.ylabel('Residuals')
```

- Acceptable: random scatter around zero.
- Problem indicators: funnel shape (heteroscedasticity), systematic curve (non-linearity not captured).

**7.4 — SHAP analysis (on best model):**

```python
import shap
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model_xgb)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test, plot_type='bar')
```

**7.5 — Bias/Variance analysis:**

- **High bias (underfitting)**: Training RMSE ≈ Test RMSE, both high → increase model complexity.
- **High variance (overfitting)**: Training RMSE << Test RMSE → add regularization, reduce features, increase training data.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

- Using MAPE as sole metric — zero `sales` values cause division by zero; use RMSLE as primary.
- Not reporting confidence intervals or variance across CV folds.
- Evaluating on training set and claiming good performance.

---

### PHASE 8 — Model Finalization

**Inputs:** Evaluation results, best model object.  
**Outputs:** Saved model file, final configuration JSON.

**Steps:**

**8.1 — Select best model:**

- Primary: lowest RMSE on held-out test set.
- Tiebreaker: lowest MAPE, then R².
- Document selection rationale explicitly.

**8.2 — Save model:**

```python
import joblib
from datetime import datetime
model_name = f"lightgbm_{datetime.today().strftime('%Y%m%d')}_v1.pkl"
joblib.dump(model_lgb, f'models/{model_name}')
```

**8.3 — Save best hyperparameters:**

```python
import json
best_params = model_lgb.get_params()
with open('models/best_params_lgbm.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(best_params, f, indent=2)
```

**8.4 — Save scaler/preprocessor:**

```python
joblib.dump(scaler, 'models/standard_scaler.pkl')
```

**8.5 — Verify reload:**

```python
model_reloaded = joblib.load(f'models/{model_name}')
y_pred_reloaded = model_reloaded.predict(X_test)
assert np.allclose(y_pred_reloaded, y_pred_original), "Predictions differ after reload!"
```

**8.6 — Document final configuration:**
Create `models/README.md` containing: model name, training date, training data date range, test RMSE/MAPE/R², feature list, preprocessing steps, random seeds used.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

- Saving model without saving corresponding scaler/preprocessor — inference fails.
- Not verifying reloaded model produces identical outputs.
- Saving model using path that includes spaces (cross-platform compatibility issue).

---

### PHASE 9 — Reporting & Presentation

**Inputs:** All outputs from Phases 1–8, SHAP plots, cannibalization report.  
**Outputs:** Final Jupyter Notebook, exported HTML report, slide deck (optional).

**Final Report Structure:**

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| 1. Executive Summary | 1 page: problem, approach, best result, key insight |
| 2. Dataset Description | Schema, provenance, citation, size |
| 3. Preprocessing | What was done, why, before/after statistics |
| 4. EDA | Minimum 5 figures with interpretations |
| 5. Feature Engineering | Feature table, rationale per group |
| 6. Model Development | Pseudocode + code for each model |
| 7. Results | Comparison table, actual vs. predicted plots |
| 8. Cannibalization Analysis | Correlation matrix, identified pairs, lift analysis |
| 9. Limitations | Data limitations, model assumptions, scope gaps |
| 10. Future Work | Multi-step forecasting, SKU-level, deep learning (LSTM) |

**Key Visualizations for Final Report:**

1. Overall pipeline flowchart (draw.io or Mermaid).
2. Model comparison bar chart (RMSE/MAPE across models).
3. Actual vs. predicted time-series for best model (top-3 store-dept pairs).
4. SHAP summary plot.
5. Cannibalization candidate heatmap.
6. Promotional lift scatter plot.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

- Claiming model "achieves 95% accuracy" — this is regression task; accuracy not valid metric.
- Omitting Limitations section — required academic element.
- Presenting results without uncertainty quantification (report CV standard deviation).
- Not running notebook end-to-end before submission.

## SECTION 5 — Academic Quality Control

---

### 5.1 Reproducibility Plan

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Random seeds** | Set `random_state=42` in all model constructors, all `numpy.random.seed(42)` calls, and `PYTHONHASHSEED=42` at script start. |
| **Seed documentation** | Seeds documented in models/README.md and in `config.py` file at project root. |
| **Environment** | `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` committed to repo; pin all package versions (e.g., `xgboost==2.0.3`). |
| **Data versioning** | Record SHA-256 hash of all input CSVs in `data/checksums.txt` file. |
| **Execution order** | Notebooks numbered (01_preprocessing, 02_eda, 03_features, etc.) to enforce execution order. |
| **Floating point** | Note floating-point results may vary across CPU architectures; report with 4 significant figures. |

---

### 5.3 Experiment Tracking

Use one of:

- **Option A (Recommended)**: MLflow with local UI.
  ```python
  import mlflow
  mlflow.set_experiment("retail-demand-forecasting")
  with mlflow.start_run(run_name="xgboost_tuned_v2"):
      mlflow.log_params(best_params)
      mlflow.log_metric("rmse_test", rmse)
      mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "xgboost_model")
  ```
- **Option B (Lightweight)**: Manually maintained `experiments_log.csv` with columns: `run_id`, `timestamp`, `model`, `hyperparams`, `rmse_train`, `rmse_test`, `mape_test`, `notes`.

Minimum tracked: model name, hyperparameters, train RMSE, test RMSE, test MAPE, random seed, training date.

---

### 5.4 Dataset Citation

Include in all report documents and README:

> Corporación Favorita. (2021). _Store Sales — Time Series Forecasting_ [Dataset]. Kaggle Competition.  
> Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting  
> License: Kaggle competition rules (for academic use).

APA format for academic report citations.

---

### 5.5 Ethical Considerations

| Consideration | Status & Action |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Privacy** | Dataset contains no personally identifiable information (PII). ✅ |
| **Bias in predictions** | Verify model does not systematically under-predict for minority store types (e.g., Type C stores). Report performance stratified by store type. |
| **Causal claims** | Do NOT claim promotional markdowns _cause_ sales increases — only correlation/association demonstrated. Use precise language: "associated with," "correlated with." |
| **Generalization claims** | Do NOT claim model will generalize to other retailers. Scope limitations must be stated explicitly. |
| **Model deployment risks** | Note that deploying inventory decisions based on model predictions without human oversight could cause financial harm if model is miscalibrated. |

---

### 5.6 Plagiarism Avoidance

- All code produced must be original or properly attributed.
- If referencing external code (e.g., SHAP tutorial), cite source as comment in code cell.
- Use `git blame` history as evidence of original authorship if challenged.
- From-scratch GD implementation must be coded independently — do NOT copy from external repositories.
- All figures and tables in report must be generated by project code, not from external sources.

---

### 5.7 Evaluation Methodology Correctness

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| **Temporal split only** | Time-series data has temporal autocorrelation; random splits cause leakage. |
| **No future features in training** | All features derived from `t` must use data available strictly before time `t`. |
| **Scaler fit on train only** | Fitting on full dataset causes test set statistics to influence training normalization (leakage). |
| **No MAPE when actuals ≈ 0** | MAPE undefined or extreme when actual values approach zero; clip or use alternative (SMAPE, RMSE). |
| **One test set** | Do not tune on test set. Use CV folds on training data for tuning; held-out test set evaluated exactly once. |
| **Report variance** | Always report CV RMSE as `mean ± std`, not just mean. |
